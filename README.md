# IPaLot: an Intelligent Parking Lot (under development)

This project describes a control system for a parking lot, 
based on reinforcement learning, where an AI can take control
of the customer's car and dispach/retrieve it to/from a
designated parking spot.

Here you can find the training simulation, working on pygame.
The training method used is a multi-agent version of the A3C model.
